# House-Price

INTRODUCTION

Using Data analysis to study and examine the data for trends in customer behavior to produce actionable insights is essential to every business. For a home buyer, buying a home involves a lot of uncertainty. Therefore, it can also be a scary yet an exciting experience.  How do you choose the best neighborhood? What are the most desired amenities? Most importantly, if we ask a home buyer to describe their dream house then they probably will not begin with the type of slab foundation or size of the garage area.  Through the exploration of the dataset, we can see there are unknown factors that are very influential in determining the house prices than the house square footage or different amenities.
